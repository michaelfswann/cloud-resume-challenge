          üë®‚Äçüíª Experienced scientist with background in chemistry
          looking to gain commercial development
          experience. After moving into IT support early on in
          my career and finding a personal aptitude, I
          retrained as a full-stack developer through the
          School of Code. I am a self-starter and enjoy
          learning about new technologies: I recently gained
          AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification. I really enjoying creating stuff: find my

        <h3>Education:</h3>
          <h4>Newcastle University Bsc (Hons) Chemistry with Medicinal Chemistry</h4> 
          <p>My favourite part of my degree was structural elucidation. This is where you are given spectra for an unknown compound e.g. IR, 13C-NMR, 1H-NMR and mass spec data and you deduce the unknown componds structure: it‚Äôs a really fun logic problem.</p>
