        <h3>Experience:</h3>
        <h4>Bootcamper - School of Code - September 2020 to Present</h4>
        <p>I joined SoC as I wanted to increase my confidence in building my own personal projects hoping this would give me the skills to build a portfolio. While on the SoC journey I spent four weeks developing a group project with four other team members. This has allowed me to develop valuable soft skills such as planning, agile methods and remote working skills. Tech skills I improved in the course of this project: Docker, BASH, AWS, Auth0 (role based access control), PostgreSQL, Express.js, Next.js and Node.js. In addition to my team-planned workload around building our express server, databases and implementing role-based access control using Auth0. I dockerized our server and deployed it to AWS. Using Docker, AWS ECS and GitHub Actions, I automated our builds and employed blue/green deployments. AWS services I learnt on this journey: Elastic Container Registry, Elastic Container Service, EC2, S3, Idendity and Access Management, creating load balancers and Route53.</p>
        <h4>Bartender ‚Äì The British Oak -  August 2017 to September 2020</h4>
        <p>Until the pandemic I worked in hospitality. Skills include working as part of a large team and working under pressure: the Oak is one of south Birmingham‚Äôs most vibrant and loved bars.</p>
        <h4>Head of Support ‚Äì HyStreet/Hidr Media ‚Äì November 2016 to July 2017</h4>
        <p>I joined as part of the start up team that launched HyStreet a SaaS company for PropTech industry. I succesfully oversaw customer support for the launch and supported the team and our clients until the company decided to focus on bricks and mortar estate agency. As part of a start up team I had a varied workload: time management was crucial in allowing me to support the team.</p>
        <h4>IT Support Manager - Applied Executive Selection ‚Äì August 2015 to October 2016</h4>

For this role I moved to an unfamiliar industry and managed a successful department maintaing all previously established functions while undertaking on the job training.</p>
        <h4>Scientist ‚Äì Worcester Scientific Services ‚Äì October 2014 to June 2015</h4>
        <p>WSS is a public analyst laboratory. I was responsible for the chemical analysis of food and animal feeds. My role at WSS required a high degree of technical skills and varied teamwork while also being responsible for managing my own workload, this required good focus and communication.</p>
